"""Correctness of IrisCommunicator's collective ops — all_reduce and all_gather
— in eager mode, under cudagraph capture + replay, AND under capture + replay
with the input changing every replay.

One question: does the iris-backed communicator produce correct results? Eager
alone is not enough — the gluon kernels elide barriers under graph capture, and a
race there only shows across a sequence of replays (vLLM captures the decode step
once and replays it every token).

But replaying the SAME input every time is also not enough: a stale-heap read
(replay k+1 reading replay k's symmetric-buffer before k's writes land) returns
the previous replay's data, and when every replay's input is identical the stale
data EQUALS the correct data, so the bug hides. vLLM never does that — it copies
a fresh activation into the static input buffer before each token's replay, so a
stale read there is the *previous token's* data = garbage. The varying-input
check (run_comm_vary) reproduces exactly that: fresh input per replay, each
replay's output checked against its own reference. That is the mode that catches
the dropped/stale all_gather race the identical-input loop misses.
